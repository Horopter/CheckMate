# CheckMate Relay Server Design Document

## 1. Introduction

The CheckMate Relay Server is a critical component in the CheckMate ecosystem. It acts as a lightweight, stateless message relay that facilitates ephemeral, end-to-end encrypted communication between clients engaged in zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) sessions. Given the scale requirements—up to 10 billion registered users and 8 billion DAUs—the design must be hyper-scalable, resilient, and optimized for low latency.

## 2. Requirements and Assumptions

### Functional Requirements
- **Ephemeral Communication:**  
  Relay ephemeral ZKP session messages without persisting user data.
- **Real-Time Message Delivery:**  
  Ensure low latency for interactive verification sessions.
- **End-to-End Security:**  
  Support TLS 1.3 and mutual authentication, certificate pinning, and optional end-to-end encryption.
- **Protocol Support:**  
  Handle WebSocket-based communication for real-time bidirectional data transfer.
- **Fault Tolerance:**  
  Operate seamlessly even if some relay nodes or regions fail.
  
### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability:**  
  Horizontally scale to support up to 8 billion DAUs and billions of concurrent connections.
- **High Availability:**  
  Achieve near 100% uptime using geo-distributed deployment and global load balancing.
- **Performance:**  
  Sub-100ms latency end-to-end even under extreme load.
- **Security:**  
  Harden against MITM, replay, and DoS attacks.

### Assumptions
- **Infrastructure:**  
  The system will run on Hostinger’s KVMs distributed globally.
- **Stateless Relay:**  
  Relay servers are stateless and act solely as message brokers.
- **Data Persistence:**  
  No long-term storage is needed; all data is ephemeral.
- **Scaling Approach:**  
  Use horizontal scaling, microservices architecture, and container orchestration.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

### Components
- **Edge Relay Nodes:**  
  Deployed in multiple geographic regions (edge data centers) to minimize latency. These nodes are stateless and handle WebSocket connections.
- **Global Load Balancer:**  
  A global DNS-based or Anycast load balancer to route user traffic to the nearest edge node.
- **Message Broker Layer:**  
  Optionally, a high-performance message broker (e.g., Kafka, NATS, or custom UDP-based relay) to facilitate inter-node communication if needed for session hand-offs.
- **Monitoring and Logging:**  
  A centralized system to monitor health, performance, and security events across all nodes.
- **Auto-Scaling Controller:**  
  Dynamically adjusts the number of relay nodes based on traffic load.

### Data Flow
1. **Connection Establishment:**  
   Users initiate a WebSocket connection through the global load balancer, which routes them to a nearby edge node.
2. **Session Initiation:**  
   The client and relay exchange ephemeral session data (ZKP session details).
3. **Message Relaying:**  
   The relay node forwards messages between connected clients with minimal processing.
4. **Session Termination:**  
   When a session ends, all associated ephemeral data is discarded.

## 4. Technology Stack

### Programming Languages & Frameworks
- **Relay Server Core:**  
  - **Go:** For its concurrency model and performance.
  - **Node.js:** As an alternative for rapid prototyping (with eventual migration to Go for production).
- **WebSocket Libraries:**  
  - Use libraries like [Gorilla WebSocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket) in Go or [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) in Node.js.
- **Security Libraries:**  
  - OpenSSL/TLS libraries (integrated with KVMs) for TLS 1.3 and mutual authentication.
  
### Infrastructure & Orchestration
- **Containerization:**  
  Docker containers to package and deploy the relay server.
- **Orchestration:**  
  Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for auto-scaling, deployment, and management.
- **Load Balancing:**  
  DNS-based Global Load Balancer (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Route 53 with latency-based routing, or custom Anycast routing).
- **Monitoring:**  
  Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/EFK stack, and custom logging for observability.

### Networking & Communication
- **Protocol:**  
  WebSocket over TLS.
- **Optimization:**  
  Connection keep-alives, low-level network tuning (TCP fast open, etc.), and UDP-based fallback if required.
  
## 5. Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless Nodes:**  
  Each relay node is stateless, allowing for near-infinite horizontal scaling.
- **Global Distribution:**  
  Deploy nodes across multiple regions to ensure low latency and balanced load.
- **Auto-Scaling:**  
  Use metrics (CPU, connection count, latency) to automatically spin up/down nodes.

### Load Balancing
- **Global Load Balancer:**  
  Route traffic to the nearest or least-loaded node.
- **Local Load Balancer:**  
  Each region may have an internal load balancer to distribute traffic among nodes.

### Connection Handling
- **Massive Concurrency:**  
  Use event-driven I/O (epoll/kqueue) and asynchronous frameworks to support millions of concurrent WebSocket connections per node.
- **Resource Optimization:**  
  Fine-tune OS and network stack settings to handle high connection counts.

## 6. High Availability and Fault Tolerance

- **Redundancy:**  
  Duplicate relay nodes in every region.
- **Failover Mechanisms:**  
  Automatic rerouting of traffic if a node or region becomes unavailable.
- **Health Checks:**  
  Continuous monitoring and health-check endpoints for each node.
- **Data Isolation:**  
  Since sessions are ephemeral, data loss during failover is acceptable as long as security is maintained.

## 7. Security Considerations

- **Encryption:**  
  Enforce TLS 1.3 with mutual authentication.
- **DDoS Protection:**  
  Integrate with upstream DDoS mitigation services, rate limiting, and IP filtering.
- **Message Integrity:**  
  Use cryptographic signing for messages where necessary.
- **Audit Logging:**  
  Log connection attempts, failures, and anomalies for further analysis.
- **Zero Trust:**  
  Ensure that nodes authenticate and validate messages without assuming trust based on network location.

## 8. API Design and Communication Protocol

### API Endpoints
- **/initiate-session:**  
  Clients initiate a ZKP session and get relay connection details.
- **/send-message:**  
  WebSocket messages for session data are relayed.
- **/terminate-session:**  
  Gracefully close a session.
  
### Protocol Specifications
- **Message Formats:**  
  JSON or Protobuf for lightweight, structured messages.
- **Ephemeral Session Tokens:**  
  Tokens derived from ZKP sessions to authenticate relay messages.
- **Timeouts and Retries:**  
  Define strict session timeouts and retry policies for message delivery.

## 9. Monitoring, Logging, and Observability

- **Real-Time Metrics:**  
  Collect metrics on connection counts, latency, error rates, and node health.
- **Distributed Logging:**  
  Centralize logs for troubleshooting and security auditing.
- **Alerting:**  
  Configure alerts for abnormal traffic, latency spikes, or node failures.
- **Dashboard:**  
  Use Grafana/Prometheus for real-time monitoring and historical analysis.

## 10. Deployment and Infrastructure

- **KVMs on Hostinger:**  
  Optimize VM configurations (memory, CPU, network) based on load tests.
- **Container Orchestration:**  
  Deploy relay nodes as containers managed by Kubernetes (or an alternative) for easy scaling and rolling updates.
- **Geo-Distributed Deployment:**  
  Use multiple data centers in different geographic regions to reduce latency and provide resilience.

## 11. Future Enhancements

- **Edge Computing:**  
  Integrate with edge networks or CDNs for even lower latency.
- **Serverless Functions:**  
  Consider using serverless for sporadic or bursty workloads.
- **AI-Driven Scaling:**  
  Use machine learning to predict load and proactively scale resources.
- **Protocol Optimizations:**  
  Explore alternative communication protocols (e.g., QUIC) for further latency improvements.
